"""
A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word;
the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.

An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is
"ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.

Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times
that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.
